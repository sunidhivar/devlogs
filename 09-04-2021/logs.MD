#What I learned today
    - pwd= print working directory
    - /=root
        -  root/Users/User 1, User 2, and User 3
    -   First, there is something called root/ and the root is the main thing then there is something called Users and in users you will see  the users you have ex.
                                                                                            - User 1
                                                                                             - User 2
                                                                                             - User 3
 - to confrm that you are in the right directory do this= pwd and it will show you something like this
 `/Users/User 3`= this means that I'm in  User 3.
 - Then, If you want to know if something is a directory or not then look at the start does it have a `d` ? if is does then that means it is a directory!
 - if you want to go to a directory then  put `cd` and the name of the directory you want to go in.
- If you want to see the list of the directories you have then put this= `ls -l` and then you will see the list of deredtories you have
- Finally, for making a directory put this = `mkdir` followed by directory name.
